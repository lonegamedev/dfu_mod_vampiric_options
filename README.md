# Vampiric Options

This mod makes playing a vampire character arguably enjoyable, by providing proper vampire character portraits and options to improve annoying bloodlust mechanic.

## Changelog (v0.51):

All options are set to vanilla by default, so remember to adjust before starting the game!

* **Portrait swap** - modifies condition for portrait swap (always/during bloodlust/never)
* **Portrait assets** - enables custom portraits replacement per face (vanilla has one portrait per race+gender)
* **Bloodlust anxiety** - enables a character to rest/loiter during bloodlust
* **Days to Bloodlust** - adjust how long it takes a vampire to reach bloodlust state.
